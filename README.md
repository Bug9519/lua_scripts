# lua_scripts
A collection of Lua scripts that I coded, straight from the Lua examples from Lua For Windows.

I coded these examples, but they are the examples that come with Lua For Windows, in the "QuickLuaTour" that launches after install. So this isn't my code, but I typed them out myself, and checked to see if they run. Obviously, they did.
